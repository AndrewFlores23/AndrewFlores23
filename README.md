# **Introduction**
Hey there! My name is Andrew Flores and I'm an up-and-coming computer programmer. 

This page is here to serve as a sort of library for personal projects and other Computer Science related endeavors I have worked on throughout my High School career.

Additionally, this page is ordered by classes and the school year in which I took them in order to allow for easy access to specific projects and files.
